    <h1>TicTacToe</h1>
    
   <h2>Welcome to Pygame TicTacToe</h2>
    <p>This project is a game that we have created in a program called pygame. It is a generic verison of Tic Tac Toe that is player vs. bot designed. The bot will always do the best possible move to win. It is basically playing Tic Tac Toe on hard mode.</p> 
    <p>We created this because Tic Tac Toe is an all around fun game that is quick, simple, and easy. Anyone can play Tic Tac Toe and thats why we decided to make our own generic verison. The creators of this project are Jay Singh, Alisa Aleksandrova, and Shitila Urshi</p>
    
   <h2>The history of TicTacToe</h2>
    <p>According to  <a href="https://aurosi.com/blog/the-history-of-tic-tac-toe-and-where-it-is-now/">Aurosi.com</a>, Tic taco toe’s history started with the Romans, but their version was, admittedly, much more difficult than the one we know today. Each player used 3 pebbles, and so had to move them around on each turn.</p>
    <p>The early Roman version was known as terni lapilli, or three pebbles at a time. In the mid-1800s, Britain used the name noughts and crosses, with nought referring to the O’s (or zeros) used in the game. The phrase tick-tack-toe wasn’t used until the late 1800s, and there’s some findings that report it might have been used to describe a completely different game. </p>
